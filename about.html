          <h2>Simple Origami Project And A Little Bit About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I enjoy making origami. Origami is a Japanise paper art. I learnt it
            from youtube and making origami is my favourite thing to do in my
            spare time. As I have now started to learn coding, I spend most of
            my time studying computer programming in a daily basis to qualify
            for the Fullstack Web Development course at CodeYourFuture.
            <br />
            The traditional origami crane is perhaps the most popular example of
            origami. It uses a bird base, which is a square base plus two petal
            folds. Traditionally, folding a thousand paper cranes is said to
            grant you the right to make one special wish.<br />
            The lovely modular origami cube box, made from six Sonobe units.
            These make great decorations or they can be used as gift boxes. If
            you use several different colored sheets of paper, they have a
            pretty patchwork effect.<br />
            Spinning tops are popular paper toys for children. This design uses
            six sheets of paper that are joined together, offering a unique
            opportunity for mixing and matching different origami paper
            patterns. These would look pretty hanging in a nursery as part of an
            origami mobile.<br />
            This origami tulip flower also has a stem that it fits onto. You
            will need two sheets of square paper for this one. Make a few and
            add them to a vase for a handmade origami flower arrangement.
