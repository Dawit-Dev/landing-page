        <h2>History Of Origami</h2>
        <p>paper folding, Japanese origami, Art of folding objects out of paper without cutting, pasting, or decorating. Its early history is unknown, but it seems to have developed from the older art of folding cloth. Origami has reached its greatest development in Japan, with hundreds of traditional folds and an extensive literature dealing with the art. There are two types of Japanese folds: figures used in ceremonial etiquette, and objects such as animals, flowers, furniture, and human figures. Some objects have amusing action features; best known is the bird that flaps its wings when its tail is pulled. Paper folding has also flourished in Spain, South America, and Germany.</p>

        <h2>Simple Origami Project And A Little Bit About Me</h2>
        <p>I enjoy making origami. Origami is a Japanise paper art. I learnt it from youtube and making origami is my favourite thing to do in my spare time. <strong>As I have now started to learn coding, I spend most of my time studying computer programming in a daily basis to qualify for the Fullstack Web Development course at CodeYourFuture.</strong><br> The traditional origami crane is perhaps the most popular example of origami. It uses a bird base, which is a square base plus two petal folds. Traditionally, folding a thousand paper cranes is said to grant you the right to make one special wish.<br>
The lovely modular origami cube box, made from six Sonobe units. These make great decorations or they can be used as gift boxes. If you use several different colored sheets of paper, they have a pretty patchwork effect.<br>
Spinning tops are popular paper toys for children. This design uses six sheets of paper that are joined together, offering a unique opportunity for mixing and matching different origami paper patterns. These would look pretty hanging in a nursery as part of an origami mobile.<br>
This origami tulip flower also has a stem that it fits onto. You will need two sheets of square paper for this one. Make a few and add them to a vase for a handmade origami flower arrangement.</p>
